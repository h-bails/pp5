Howdy {{ consignment.user_profile.full_name }}!

Your consignment request to Tubular Retro has been respectfully declined. 
This decision could stem from several factors, but more often than not, 
it's because we do not foresee a significant demand for the particular item or 
it doesn't align well with the overall theme of our shop.
